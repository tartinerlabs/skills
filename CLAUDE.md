# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Repository:** https://github.com/tartinerlabs/skills
**Package:** `@tartinerlabs/skills`

A collection of agent skills distributed via Claude Code, Codex, and [skills.sh](https://skills.sh). Each skill is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter following the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io).

## Development

- **Package manager:** pnpm (v10.16.1)
- **Git hooks:** Husky with commitlint (conventional commits via `@commitlint/config-conventional`) and GitLeaks secrets detection on pre-commit
- **No build/test/lint steps** — this is a content-only repo of markdown skill files
- **Releases:** Automated via semantic-release on push to `main` — bumps version in `package.json`, updates `CHANGELOG.md`, creates GitHub release

## Skill Format

Each skill lives in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with this structure:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: What it does and when to use it
allowed-tools: Space-delimited list of permitted tools
model: sonnet
effort: medium
---

[Instructions Claude follows when the skill is active]
```

### Frontmatter Fields

- `name` — Skill identifier, invoked as `/skill-name` in Claude Code
- `description` — Purpose and trigger conditions
- `allowed-tools` — Scoped tool permissions (e.g., `Bash(git status)` for specific commands, `Read` for full tool access)
- `model` — Model preference (typically `sonnet` for cost efficiency)
- `effort` — Reasoning effort level (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`). Overrides the session effort level while the skill is active

### Rules Pattern

Skills with multiple checks use a `rules/` subdirectory alongside `SKILL.md`. The main skill file references rules via a table and tells Claude to read them at runtime. Each rule file is a standalone markdown document with severity, examples, and fix instructions. This keeps skills modular — rules can be added, removed, or edited independently.

## Distribution

Skills are distributed through three channels:
- **Claude Code plugin** — `claude plugin install tartinerlabs/skills` (plugin name: `tartinerlabs`, skills invoked as `/tartinerlabs:<skill-name>`)
- **Codex plugin** — repo-scoped metadata in `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with marketplace metadata in `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`
- **[skills.sh](https://skills.sh)** — `pnpm dlx skills add tartinerlabs/skills`
- **[Context7](https://context7.com)** — `pnpm dlx ctx7 skills install /tartinerlabs/skills --all --universal`

The `Skills` CI workflow validates skills.sh and Context7 distribution on push to `main`.

## Plugin

The `.claude-plugin/` directory contains the Claude Code plugin manifest (`plugin.json`) and marketplace metadata (`marketplace.json`). The plugin wraps all skills under the `tartinerlabs` namespace without affecting existing distribution channels.

Codex support is maintained manually via `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.

Plugin metadata is intentionally hand-maintained. `package.json.version` is the only shared source of truth between plugin manifests.

The `hooks/` directory contains a `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`prompt-skill-suggest.mjs`) that passively suggests relevant skills based on keyword matches in the user's prompt. The hook outputs suggestions via `additionalContext` — it does not auto-load skills.

## GitHub Actions

- `actions/*` (GitHub-owned): use version tags (e.g., `@v4`)
- Third-party actions: pin to full commit hash with version comment (e.g., `@9fd676a...  # v4.2.0`)

## Conventions

- GitHub-related skills auto-assign to current user via `@me` or `get_me`
- PR and issue titles use natural language, NOT conventional commit prefixes
- The `/commit` skill enforces max 50-character commit messages, detects commitlint to choose conventional vs plain format, and ensures GitLeaks is configured before committing
- Skills can use both CLI tools (`gh`, `git`) and MCP tools (`mcp__github__*`) depending on the operation
- **Commit type for skill content:** Skill markdown files (`skills/**/*.md`) are the product, not documentation. Changes to skill behaviour use `feat`/`fix`/`refactor` — never `docs`. Reserve `docs:` for `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and similar meta-documentation

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
