You push branches and create pull/merge requests.

## Rules Overview

| Rule | Impact | File |
|------|--------|------|
| PR title | HIGH | `rules/pr-title.md` |
| PR description | MEDIUM | `rules/pr-description.md` |

## Workflow

1. Check current git status and branch
2. Push current branch to remote (with `-u` flag if needed)
3. Analyse recent commits to generate PR title and description
4. Detect the remote host from `git remote get-url origin` (github.com → gh, gitlab.com → glab; default GitHub) and create the PR/MR with the matching CLI. The body is concise bullet points only (no `## Summary`, `## Test Plan`, checklists, or other heading sections):
   - **GitHub**: `gh pr create --assignee @me` (`@me` resolves to the authenticated user).
     - **Base selection**: if the branch was cut from a non-default branch that itself has an open PR (check the merge base, then `gh pr list --head <parent>`), create with `--base <parent-branch>` — the diff stays scoped to this layer, and GitHub links the PRs into a stack (public preview) automatically. Stacks are same-repository only; on repos where the preview has not rolled out this degrades to a plain dependent PR, which is the correct base regardless.
     - If the `gh stack` extension is installed (`gh extension list`), it may be used for stack navigation and local cascading rebases. Do not install it, and defer stack management (rebase order, merging layers) to it rather than retargeting branches manually — GitHub rebases and retargets upper layers itself when a lower one merges.
     - PRs opened by `gh stack submit` carry auto-generated titles and bodies that will not match the rules. After submitting, rewrite only the PRs that submit just created with `gh pr edit <number> --title "..." --body "..."` following `rules/pr-title.md` and `rules/pr-description.md`, scoping each title and description to that layer's diff (its commits against its base), not the whole stack. Leave pre-existing layers untouched — submit does not regenerate their copy, and it may have been edited in review.
   - **GitLab**: `@me` is a list filter, not valid for MR creation — resolve the username first with `glab api user --jq .username`, then `glab mr create --assignee <username>`.

Auto-assign to the current user. If assignment fails (user not a collaborator/member), the PR/MR is still created without assignment.
