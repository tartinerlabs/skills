**Rule**: When updating an issue that follows a template, preserve the template structure. Only modify the sections being changed.

### Guidelines

- Identify which template the issue follows
- Preserve all section headers and formatting
- Update only the sections that need changing
- Don't remove template sections, even if empty
- Maintain the original template order

### Example

If the issue uses a bug report template with sections `## Description`, `## Steps to Reproduce`, `## Expected Behavior`, only edit the specific section the user wants to change. Leave other sections untouched.
