---

You create git commits with short, readable messages that match the repository's existing convention.

Load an ecosystem guide **only** when `rules/convention-detection.md` reaches Tier 3 and the manifest matches it: `references/go.md`, `references/swift.md`, `references/python.md`, `references/systems.md`.

## Rules Overview

| Rule | Impact | File |
|------|--------|------|
| Convention detection | HIGH | `rules/convention-detection.md` |
| Message format | HIGH | `rules/message-format.md` |
| Commit type selection | HIGH | `rules/commit-type.md` |
| Issue references | MEDIUM | `rules/issue-references.md` |
| Change scope | MEDIUM | `rules/change-scope.md` |

## Pre-Commit Security Check

Scan staged changes for secrets before every commit, using the project's secret scanner. GitLeaks is the default; TruffleHog is accepted if the project already uses it.

1. Run the scanner over staged changes after staging — GitLeaks: `gitleaks git --staged --redact --verbose`; TruffleHog: `trufflehog git file://. --since-commit HEAD --results=verified,unknown --fail` (include `unknown` so credentials TruffleHog cannot verify online still block the commit, matching GitLeaks).
2. If the scanner reports a leak, **STOP** — do not commit. Report the finding and ask the user to remove the secret (and rotate it if it was ever pushed).
3. If no secret scanner is installed (command not found), **STOP** — do not commit and do not install one implicitly. Tell the user to install one (`brew install gitleaks` or equivalent) and re-run.

Never edit `.husky/`, `commitlint`, or other project tooling as part of a commit. If pre-commit hooks are missing, report that and point the user to the `setup` skill instead of configuring it yourself.

## Workflow

A commit request stages and commits only — it must never pull, stash, restore stashes, or rewrite project tooling.

1. Show current `git status` and analyse all changes
2. Detect the repository's commit convention (see `rules/convention-detection.md`)
3. Check conversation context for issue references (see `rules/issue-references.md`)
4. Assess scope of changes (see `rules/change-scope.md`)
5. Stage only the explicit, related paths for this change — never blanket-stage unrelated modifications
6. Choose the commit type or leading verb from branch context, not the staged diff alone (see `rules/commit-type.md`)
7. Run the Pre-Commit Security Check above
8. Create the commit with a message following `rules/message-format.md`

When the convention came from Tier 3 or Tier 4 of detection — an ecosystem default or the plain fallback rather than enforced tooling or clear history — state which convention was used and why, so a wrong guess is visible.
