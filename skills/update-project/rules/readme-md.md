**Rule**: Keep public project documentation up-to-date by verifying all sections against actual project state.

### What to Scan

- **Installation**: Dependencies, requirements, setup steps
- **Usage examples**: Code samples, API documentation
- **Links**: External links, badges, references
- **Project status**: Current features, version info

### What to Update

- Refresh installation steps to match current tooling
- Update code examples to reflect current API
- Fix broken or outdated links
- Update badges and version references
- Add new features or remove deprecated ones

### What NOT to Do

- Don't remove sections without understanding their purpose
- Don't change the README structure unless it's clearly outdated
- Don't add internal implementation details (that belongs in CLAUDE.md)
