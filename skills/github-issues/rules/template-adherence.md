**Rule**: When issue templates exist in the repository, follow and preserve the template structure.

### Creating with a Template

1. Identify the most appropriate template (bug report, feature request, etc.)
2. Parse template structure and required sections
3. Fill in all required fields with relevant information from user context
4. Preserve template formatting and section headers

### Updating a Templated Issue

- Identify which template the issue follows
- Preserve all section headers and formatting
- Update only the sections that need changing
- Don't remove template sections, even if empty
- Maintain the original template order

### Creating without a Template

Use a clear, structured format:

```markdown
## Problem
[Clear problem statement or feature description]

## Context
[Steps to reproduce (bugs) or additional details (features)]
```

Keep it concise and actionable.
