**Rule**: Quarantine newly published packages by requiring a minimum age before installation.

### Configuration

Add to `.npmrc` (pnpm only):

```ini
minimum-release-age=10080
```

The value is in **minutes**. 10080 minutes = 7 days.

### Package Manager Support

| Package Manager | Supported | Config |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| pnpm | Yes | `minimum-release-age` in `.npmrc` |
| npm | No | Not available |
| yarn | No | Not available |
| bun | No | Not available |

**Skip this rule for non-pnpm projects.**

### What It Does

Prevents installation of packages published less than 7 days ago. Only affects new installs and version bumps — packages already in the lockfile are unaffected.

### Why This Matters

Many supply chain attacks exploit a narrow window after publication:
- **Protestware** — maintainers publish destructive updates that get reverted quickly
- **Typosquatting** — malicious packages mimicking popular names are reported and removed within days
- **Account compromise** — hijacked maintainer accounts publish backdoors that are caught by the community

A 7-day quarantine gives the community time to detect and flag malicious releases before they reach your project.
